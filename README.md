# Labb1pp Docker Image

This is a Dockerfile to create a Docker image for the Labb1pp application. The Docker image is based on the .NET 7.0 SDK and ASP.NET 7.0 runtime images from Microsoft.

## Structure

The Dockerfile is structured as a multi-stage build to optimize the final image size:

1. **Base stage** - This is based on the ASP.NET 7.0 runtime Docker image. The application is run from this stage.
2. **Build stage** - This is based on the .NET 7.0 SDK Docker image. The application is built in this stage.
3. **Publish stage** - This stage takes the build output and publishes it to be ready for deployment.
4. **Final stage** - This stage prepares the final Docker image for the application.

## Ports

The application Docker image exposes ports 80 and 443.

## Building the Docker Image

To build the Docker image, navigate to the directory containing the Dockerfile and run the following command:

```bash
docker build -t labb1pp .
```

## Running the Docker Image

To run the Docker image, use the following command:

```bash
docker run -p 8080:80 -p 8443:443 labb1pp
```

This command maps port 80 in the Docker container to port 8080 on the host machine, and port 443 in the Docker container to port 8443 on the host machine.

## Application Entry Point

The entry point for the application when the Docker container is run is `dotnet labb1pp.dll`.

Please adapt this README to suit the specific needs and details of your application. The commands and descriptions are based on the provided Dockerfile and general Docker usage, but your actual use case might differ.
